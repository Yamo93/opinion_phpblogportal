# The "Opinion" Blog Portal

This is a blog portal which is initially a school project. The goal was to create a dynamic web page with database connections (using PDO) and adding user authentication, as well as providing the fundamental blogging features.

I also used Bootstrap for creating various components, as well as the SASS pre-processor.
